The CEILING() formula rounds a number up to the nearest given multiple. In our case, 
we will round 3.24 up to a multiple of 1 and get 4. 
If the multiple is 5, it will round up the number 3.24 to 5. 

=CEILING(A1,1)

OR

=CEILING(A1,5)


The FLOOR() rounds a number down to the nearest given multiple. As we can see in the image below, 
instead of converting 3.24 to 4, it has rounded the number to 3.  

=FLOOR(A1,1)
