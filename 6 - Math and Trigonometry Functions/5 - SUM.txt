The SUM() formula performs addition on selected cells. It works on cells containing numerical values and requires two or more cells.  

In our case, we will be applying the SUM formula to a range of cells from A1 to A5 and storing the result on C6. It will add 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50. 
You can also apply this formula to multiple columns.

=SUM(A1:A5)
