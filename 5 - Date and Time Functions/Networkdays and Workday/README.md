In Excel, both `NETWORKDAYS()` and `WORKDAY()` functions are used to **calculate or work with business days (excluding weekends and optionally holidays)**. Here's how they differ and how to use them:

---

### ✅ `NETWORKDAYS(start_date, end_date, [holidays])`
**Purpose**: Returns the **number of working days** between two dates, including the start and end dates, excluding weekends and optionally holidays.

#### Example:
```excel
=NETWORKDAYS("2025-04-01", "2025-04-24")
```
➡️ Counts how many weekdays (Mon–Fri) are between April 1 and April 24, 2025.

#### With holidays:
```excel
=NETWORKDAYS("2025-04-01", "2025-04-24", A1:A3)
```
➡️ A1:A3 contains dates of public holidays that should be excluded.

---

### ✅ `WORKDAY(start_date, days, [holidays])`
**Purpose**: Returns the **future or past workday** from a start date, counting a certain number of workdays.

#### Example:
```excel
=WORKDAY("2025-04-01", 10)
```
➡️ Returns the date that is 10 working days after April 1, 2025 (skipping weekends).

#### With holidays:
```excel
=WORKDAY("2025-04-01", 10, A1:A3)
```
➡️ Also skips dates listed in `A1:A3` as holidays.

### Quick Comparison:

| Function      | Purpose                           | Returns         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| `NETWORKDAYS` | Count weekdays between 2 dates    | Number          |
| `WORKDAY`     | Add/subtract weekdays to a date   | A new date      |

---

If you’re trying to **count how many weekdays (excluding holidays) between two dates**, use `NETWORKDAYS()`.

If you want to **find a future/past workday**, use `WORKDAY()`.

Let me know if you want to include **custom weekends** (e.g., Friday & Saturday off), which is possible using `NETWORKDAYS.INTL()` or `WORKDAY.INTL()`!
