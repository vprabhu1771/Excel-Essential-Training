Yes! The `DATEDIF()` function in Excel is a hidden gem ‚Äî it's not listed in Excel's formula autocomplete or documentation, but it's powerful for calculating the difference between two dates in a variety of formats.

### üîß Syntax:
```excel
DATEDIF(start_date, end_date, unit)
```

- **start_date**: The beginning date.
- **end_date**: The ending date.
- **unit**: A string that specifies the type of difference to return.

### üìè Units and Their Meanings:

| Unit | Description                             | Example Output |
|------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
| `"Y"`  | Full years between dates                | `5`            |
| `"M"`  | Full months between dates               | `62`           |
| `"D"`  | Days between dates                      | `1893`         |
| `"MD"` | Days excluding months and years         | `14`           |
| `"YM"` | Months excluding years                  | `2`            |
| `"YD"` | Days excluding years                    | `134`          |

### üß™ Example:

Suppose:
- A1: `01/01/2020`
- B1: `04/15/2025`

```excel
=DATEDIF(A1, B1, "Y")    ‚Üí 5   (Full years)
=DATEDIF(A1, B1, "M")    ‚Üí 63  (Total months)
=DATEDIF(A1, B1, "D")    ‚Üí 1935 (Total days)
=DATEDIF(A1, B1, "YM")   ‚Üí 3   (Extra months after full years)
=DATEDIF(A1, B1, "MD")   ‚Üí 14  (Extra days after full months)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- `start_date` **must be earlier** than `end_date`, otherwise it throws a `#NUM!` error.
- It‚Äôs especially useful for calculating **age**, **tenure**, or **date differences in readable parts** (like years, months, days).

Want an example like age calculation from a date of birth?
