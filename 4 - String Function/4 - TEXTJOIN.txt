The TEXTJOIN function in Excel is used to concatenate multiple strings with a specified delimiter. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cells A1, A2, and A3:

A1: Apple
A2: Banana
A3: Orange

Now, you want to combine these strings into a single cell, separated by commas.

To do this, you can use the TEXTJOIN function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, A1:A3)

In this formula, the parameters are as follows:

1. ", ": The first parameter is the delimiter (in this case, a comma followed by a space) that you want to use to separate the strings.
2. TRUE: The second parameter indicates whether to ignore empty cells or not. TRUE means empty cells will be ignored, and FALSE means empty cells will be included in the result.
3. A1:A3: The third parameter specifies the range of cells that contain the strings you want to join.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "Apple, Banana, Orange"

The TEXTJOIN function is especially useful when you have a range of cells containing text data that you want to concatenate with a specified delimiter, and you can easily control whether to include empty cells or not in the final result.
