The UPPER function in Excel is used to convert a text string to uppercase. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cell A1:

A1: "excel is amazing"

Now, you want to convert this text to uppercase.

To do this, you can use the UPPER function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =UPPER(A1)

In this formula, the parameter is as follows:

1. A1: The parameter is the cell reference (or text string) that you want to convert to uppercase.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "EXCEL IS AMAZING"

The UPPER function converts all the letters in the text to uppercase, making the entire string in capital letters.

The UPPER function is useful when you need to convert text to uppercase for consistency, formatting, or comparison purposes. It's commonly used in data cleaning, normalization, or when dealing with case-insensitive data.
