The SUBSTITUTE function in Excel is used to replace occurrences of a substring with another substring within a text string. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cell A1:

A1: "Excel is amazing and Excel is powerful."

Now, you want to replace all occurrences of "Excel" with "Microsoft Excel" in this text string.

To do this, you can use the SUBSTITUTE function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =SUBSTITUTE(A1, "Excel", "Microsoft Excel")

In this formula, the parameters are as follows:

1. A1: The first parameter is the cell reference (or text string) where you want to perform the substitution.
2. "Excel": The second parameter is the substring you want to replace. In this case, it's "Excel".
3. "Microsoft Excel": The third parameter is the new substring that will replace the old substring.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "Microsoft Excel is amazing and Microsoft Excel is powerful."

The SUBSTITUTE function finds all occurrences of "Excel" in the text and replaces them with "Microsoft Excel". It's important to note that SUBSTITUTE is case-sensitive, so it only replaces exact matches.

If you want to perform a case-insensitive substitution, you can use a combination of the SUBSTITUTE function with the SEARCH or FIND function, like this:

B1: =SUBSTITUTE(A1, "excel", "Microsoft Excel")

This formula will replace both "Excel" and "excel" with "Microsoft Excel" in the text.

The SUBSTITUTE function is helpful when you need to replace specific substrings within a text string, and it can be used for various text cleaning and data transformation tasks.
