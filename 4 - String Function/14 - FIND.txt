The FIND function in Excel is used to find the position of a substring within a text string. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cell A1:

A1: "Excel is amazing!"

Now, you want to find the position of the word "amazing" in this text string.

To do this, you can use the FIND function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =FIND("amazing", A1)

In this formula, the parameters are as follows:

1. "amazing": The first parameter is the substring you want to find. In this case, it's the word "amazing".
2. A1: The second parameter is the cell reference (or text string) within which you want to search for the substring.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "10"

The FIND function returns the position of the substring "amazing" in the text string "Excel is amazing!". In this case, "amazing" starts at the 10th position in the text string.

It's important to note that the FIND function is case-sensitive. If you want to perform a case-insensitive search, you can use the SEARCH function instead of FIND.

The FIND function is helpful when you need to locate the position of a specific substring within a text, and you can use this position for further text manipulation or analysis.
