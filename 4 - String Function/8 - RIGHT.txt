The RIGHT function in Excel is used to extract a specified number of characters from the end (rightmost) side of a text string. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cell A1:

A1: "Excel is amazing!"

Now, you want to extract the last 7 characters from this text.

To do this, you can use the RIGHT function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =RIGHT(A1, 7)

In this formula, the parameters are as follows:

1. A1: The first parameter is the cell reference (or text string) from which you want to extract characters.
2. 7: The second parameter specifies the number of characters you want to extract from the right side.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "amazing!"

The RIGHT function is useful when you need to extract a specific number of characters from the end of a text string, and it's particularly handy for tasks like extracting suffixes or file extensions from cell contents.
