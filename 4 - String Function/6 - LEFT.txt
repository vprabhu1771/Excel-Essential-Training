The LEFT function in Excel is used to extract a specified number of characters from the beginning (leftmost) side of a text string. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cell A1:

A1: "Excel is amazing!"

Now, you want to extract the first 5 characters from this text.

To do this, you can use the LEFT function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =LEFT(A1, 5)

In this formula, the parameters are as follows:

1. A1: The first parameter is the cell reference (or text string) from which you want to extract characters.
2. 5: The second parameter specifies the number of characters you want to extract from the left side.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "Excel"

The LEFT function is useful when you need to extract a specific number of characters from the beginning of a text string, and it's particularly handy for tasks like truncating text or extracting prefixes from cell contents.
