The TRIM function in Excel is used to remove leading and trailing spaces from a text string. It doesn't remove single spaces between words within the text. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cell A1:

A1: "   Excel is amazing    "

Now, you want to remove the leading and trailing spaces from this text.

To do this, you can use the TRIM function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =TRIM(A1)

In this formula, the parameter is as follows:

1. A1: The parameter is the cell reference (or text string) from which you want to remove leading and trailing spaces.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "Excel is amazing"

The TRIM function removes the extra spaces at the beginning and end of the text, leaving only the spaces between words intact. This is helpful for cleaning up data that may have unnecessary spaces, especially when you are dealing with text copied from external sources or databases.

Please note that TRIM only removes spaces and non-printable characters at the beginning and end of the text string. If you want to remove all spaces, including those between words, you can use the SUBSTITUTE function to replace spaces with empty strings, like this:

B1: =SUBSTITUTE(A1, " ", "")

This will give you: "Excelisamazing"
