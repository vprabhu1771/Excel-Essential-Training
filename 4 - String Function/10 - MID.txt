The MID function in Excel is used to extract a substring from a text string, given a starting position and the number of characters to extract. Here's an example:

Let's say you have the following data in cell A1:

A1: "Excel is amazing!"

Now, you want to extract the word "is" from this text, which starts at the 7th character and is 2 characters long.

To do this, you can use the MID function in cell B1 (or any other cell):

B1: =MID(A1, 7, 2)

In this formula, the parameters are as follows:

1. A1: The first parameter is the cell reference (or text string) from which you want to extract the substring.
2. 7: The second parameter specifies the starting position of the substring. In this case, it starts from the 7th character.
3. 2: The third parameter specifies the number of characters to extract. In this case, you want to extract 2 characters.

After entering the formula in cell B1, it will display: "is"

The MID function is useful when you need to extract a specific portion of a text string based on its starting position and the number of characters you want to extract. It's commonly used for parsing data or extracting substrings with a known pattern from cell contents.
